# Features
- **Command Categorization**: Classify commands based on usage (e.g., Git commands, file operations, Docker commands).
- **Most Frequent Commands**: Display the most commonly used commands with usage statistics.
- **Dangerous Commands Detection**: Highlight potentially dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf`, `shutdown`).
- **Date/Time Filtering**: Analyze command history based on specific date and time ranges (e.g., last 24 hours, last week).
- **Command Grouping and Tagging**: Organize commands into meaningful groups like Git, Docker, etc.
- **Execution Statistics**: Display execution time for commands.
- **Suggestions and Recommendations**: Get recommendations based on your command history.
- **Visualization**: Generate graphs of command usage over time and command frequency using **GNUplot**.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Set up alerts for commands that match specific patterns.
- **Frequent Command Combinations**: Detect frequently executed command combinations.
- **History File Cleanup**: Option to clean up sensitive data in your history file.
- **Exporting and Logging**: Export command analysis results to CSV/JSON files and log all actions.
- **Multithreading Support**: Use parallel processing for handling large history files.
- **Real-Time Command Tracking**: Track and log commands as they are executed in real-time.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
- **Bash**: This program is designed to work with the Bash shell.
- **GNUplot**: Required for generating command frequency and time-of-day visualizations.
- **GNU Parallel**: For parallel processing of command history (optional for multithreading).
## Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, use the following commands:

**On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnuplot parallel
```

**On Fedora/RHEL-based systems:**
```bash
sudo dnf install gnuplot parallel
```

**On Archlinux-based systems:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S gnuplot parallel
```

# Download and Setup
1.**Clone the repository or download the script manually**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intrepidDev101/HistoriX.git
cd HistoriX
```

2.**Make the script executable**:

```bash
chmod +x history_analyzer.sh
```

3.**Run the script**:

```bash
./history_analyzer.sh
```

# Usage
When you run **HistoriX**, you'll be presented with an interactive menu where you can choose from various options to analyze your command history. Below is an overview of the options:

#### Main Menu Options:

1.**Analyze History**: Analyze and display various statistics and command breakdowns.

- **Most Frequent Commands**: Shows the top 10 most frequently used commands.
- **Commands Run with sudo**: Displays all commands that were executed with `sudo`.
- **Unique Commands**: Lists unique commands executed in your shell.
- **Potentially Dangerous Commands**: Highlights risky commands (e.g., `rm -rf`).
- **Total Commands**: Displays the total number of commands in your history.

2.**Generate Visualization**: Creates graphical visualizations using GNUplot. Options include:

- **Frequency Chart**: Visualizes the most frequent commands.
- **Time-of-Day Usage**: Visualizes command usage patterns over time.

3.**Suggestions**: Provides recommendations based on your history (e.g., safer alternatives to risky commands).

4.**Filter by Date**: Filter command history based on a date range (e.g., last 24 hours, last week).

5.**Group/Tag Commands**: Categorize commands into groups for better analysis (e.g., `git`, `docker`).

6.**Execution Statistics**: View the execution time of commands.

7.**Clean History File**: Optionally clean up sensitive data (passwords, tokens) from your history file.

8.**Export Results**: Export your analysis results to CSV or JSON files.

9.**Detect Frequent Combinations**: Detect frequently run command combinations (e.g., git pull && git merge).

10.Send Alerts: Set up alerts based on command patterns (e.g., commands involving rm or sudo).

11.**Process in Parallel**: Use GNU Parallel to process your history file faster.

12.**Track Real-time Commands**: Enable real-time tracking of commands executed in the shell.

13.**User-Specific Analysis**: Analyze the command history for the current user.

14.**Categorize Commands**: Categorize commands based on simple patterns like Git, Docker, etc.

15.**Time-of-Day Analysis**: Analyze the frequency of commands executed at different times of the day.

16.**Exit**: Exit the program.

# Customizable Alerts

HistoriX allows you to set up alerts based on command patterns. For example, you can create an alert for any command that involves `sudo` or `rm -rf` by selecting the **Send Alerts** option.

**Example alert**:

```bash
Alert: Found command 'sudo rm -rf /'
```

# Visualizations
HistoriX can generate GNUplot visualizations for command usage. The following visualizations are available:

1.**Command Frequency Chart**: Displays the most used commands in a bar chart.

2.**Time-of-Day Usage**: Shows command execution patterns based on the time of day.
Visualizations are saved as PNG files in `/tmp` (or any other directory you specify).

# Command History Cleanup
The **Clean History File** option allows you to remove sensitive data (e.g., `passwords`, `tokens`) from your history file. This is useful if you want to maintain privacy or prevent sensitive information from appearing in your history.

# Exporting Results
You can export your analysis to CSV or JSON files. This is useful for long-term analysis or sharing with others.

**Example command**:

```bash
Exported to command_history.csv
```
